# ImageAnnotationForClassification

Use this Jupyter Notebook to "Annotate Images for Classification"

I have used Pigeon & Ipython to annotate the images.

The Notebook contains the script for installing the libraries. '\n'
      'pip install pigeon-jupyter' '\n'
      'pip install shutil'
      
Happy Annotating :)
